# Hawthornbunny's Timeline

Hawthornbunny has been working on this timeline in parallel with this project and will be posting it on Fimfiction in the Time Loop forums.  It's a magnificent piece of work already so breaking it apart to merge into the guides would do it a disservice.  Several people have suggested that a full timeline be added next to the Guides.  This will do quite nicely.  This timeline has been reformatted for markdown.

## Legend

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] This event is known to have occurred, and was witnessed and remembered by Twilight. It was either shown in the story, or is recounted to us from Twilight's memory.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] This event was not shown in the story, and Twilight doesn't remember it, but we can infer that it happened based on how we know Twilight begins the loop, and what other timeloopers said. The inference may not be correct and could change as we gain more information.
![Speculation alt text][pic_Speculation] Personal speculation.

## The Timeline

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight casts the spell that initiates her timeloop, beginning the events of Hard Reset.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight experiences several hundred loops during this time, in which she discovers the changeling invasion and the imminent destruction of Equestria by the Elements of Harmony.

- - -

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight resets, and takes an unknown action, the result of which is that another timelooper's loop resets. It may be that she killed an existing timelooper, or that she somehow put another pony into a timeloop. Whatever happened, we know that the new timelooper's anchor point is more than one thousand years ago.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] The new timelooper changes something in the past, more than one thousand years ago. As a result, Celestia casts her own timeloop spell shortly after Luna is banished one thousand years ago, so that she won't ever be able to make such a mistake again.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia lives the next 1000 years, using her timeloop ability to prevent disasters (and the occasional personal embarrassment). We know that her anchor point can be updated - presumably this happens every day, so that whenever she dies, she returns to the beginning of the day.
![Speculation alt text][pic_Speculation] It's implied from what she later says to Twilight, that Twilight is not the first pony with whom she's been in a timeloop situation. Perhaps she had a student during this time who also had the ability to timeloop?
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] At some point during this 1000 years, Celestia deliberately buries a piece of knowledge in her mind, and sets up the 'Preengaged blackout deharmonizes antihunting dissertation' phrase to protect it.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight is born, and apparently lives her life in much the same way as she did before the timeline was changed. She becomes Celestia's student, restores the Elements of Harmony, cures Princess Luna, moves to Ponyville, and even learns most of the same lessons. The changeling invasion occurs as before, only this time, something delays it to a few hours earlier.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight casts the timeloop ritual.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight resets into the new loop, beginning the events of Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder. She notices immediately that Spike's wording is slightly different, and realises something has changed. She also finds out the changeling invasion has been delayed.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] She takes advantage of the opportunity to see Celestia immediately, and tells Celestia about being stuck in a timeloop. Although she has told Celestia this many times before, it's different now. This is not the Celestia Twilight knew - this is a Celestia who has spent her whole life timelooping, and knows exactly what Twilight is talking about.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia casts an unknown magic spell. Whatever it is, it doesn't appear to be unicorn magic, as it requires a vocal component and doesn't use her horn.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia gives Twilight a phrase to recite - 'Preengaged blackout deharmonizes antihunting dissertation' - telling her that if things don't work on this pass, that Twilight should recite the phrase to her in the next loop.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Two guards report that the building is on fire. This is apparently the work of Chrysalis and her infiltrators.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] One of the guards turns out to be Chrysalis, who breaks Twilight's neck and kills her.

- - -

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight resets. The loop is still altered as it was previously, with Spike's new phrase and with the changeling invasion delayed.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight goes to Celestia and recites the phrase 'Preengaged blackout deharmonizes antihunting dissertation' as Celestia requested. The phrase activates some kind of spell in Celestia, but the spell turns out to have an effect which paralyses the person who activated it - in this case, Twilight.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia reveals that the spell requires a safeword - 'coruscating' - which Twilight did not give. As such, Celestia has to treat her as a threat to Equestria.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia tells Twilight the safeword, knowing that if Twilight truly is in a timeloop, she will retain that information in the next loop.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia telekinetically breaks Twilight's neck, killing her.

- - -

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight resets.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight goes to Celestia, and this time, says the safeword before the phrase. The phrase activates Celestia's spell, paralysing Twilight as before, but with the addition of the safeword, Celestia knows that Twilight truly must have been through a timeloop, and can be trusted.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] The only option for Celestia at this point is to reset herself. With Twilight paralysed, there's nothing more that Celestia can get out of her; in addition, the paralysis is painful and possibly deadly, and Celestia doesn't want Twilight to suffer or die. Celestia casts a spell to kill herself and reset her loop.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia resets back several hours to the beginning of the morning, and waits out the day. During this time, she learns the circumstances under which Twilight cast the timeloop spell, and also discovers the changeling invasion.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia spends several more loops learning everything she can about the changeling invasion. She discovers that Chrysalis is also a timelooper. Despite several attempts to prevent the invasion by changing the past, she cannot defeat the invasion because Chrysalis simply changes her tactics every time she loses. The best Celestia has been able to do is force Chrysalis to commit so heavily to the invasion that she cannot now back out.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] After enough loops of fighting Chrysalis to a stalemate, Celestia decides to deal with Twilight again. She appears in the library just as Twilight casts the timeloop ritual and begins her loop.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight is surprised to see her and a little shocked from the last loop she remembers, in which Celestia broke her neck. However, remembering that Celestia told her to say the phrase with the safeword, she does so. Celestia isn't quick enough to stop her, and Twilight is paralysed again. Celestia is forced to give up on this loop and reset.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia resets, and once more, waits out the morning, then goes to see Twilight in the library when Twilight's loop starts. This time, she is quick enough to stop Twilight from saying the phrase.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight asks two questions. We don't know what these questions are, because we only hear Twilight ask them in a later loop (and Celestia gives the answers before Twilight can finish the questions, having already heard Twilight ask them previously). However, we can infer that the conversation went as follows:

> Twilight: "You're in a time loop too?!"
> 
> Celestia: "Yes."
> 
> Twilight: "Did I somehow bring you into my time loop?"
> 
> Celestia: "No, this is my own loop, independent from yours."
> 
> Twilight: "When did your loop start?"
> 
> Celestia: "My reset point was first thing this morning, though I cast the original spell right after I was forced to banish Luna.  I promised myself I wouldn't ever let those I loved go through such pain again."

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight immediately realises that Celestia has, by inaction, deliberately kept her in the time loop, and may in fact have done so many times already. After everything she's been through, she is devastated and furious with Celestia for allowing her to face such torture.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia is upset, but understands Twilight's anger and allows her to calm down. She tells Twilight about Chrysalis's timelooping ability, and explains that she needs Twilight to break the stalemate.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight asks for some time to consider this. Since they're in a timeloop, Celestia has no problem with Twilight taking all the time she needs. To make things easier, she gives Twilight a suicide spell - Euthanatos - which allows a caster to kill themselves quickly and painlessly.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia also suggests to Twilight that they use a counting system to count how many loops each of them has experienced, so that they can keep track of each other. She begins it at C-0, T-0.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight leaves Canterlot to mull things over. Unfortunately, she forgets that this puts her further away from the Elements than Celestia. The Elements explode in Canterlot, killing Celestia and resetting her loop.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia resets, realising that Twilight must have left mistakenly left Canterlot.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia re-enacts the events of the previous loop, this time telling Twilight not to leave Canterlot. The loop count remains at C-0, T-0, as Twilight doesn't remember the introduction of the loop counter from the previous loop.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight stays in Canterlot to mull things over, still angry with Celestia. She realises that because she's the only one who remembers events in her own timeloop, she can lie to Celestia and pretend that she has spent 34 horrid, miserable loops in Celestia's company, failing to make any progress because of Celestia's behaviour.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight casts the Euthanatos spell and kills herself, resetting her loop.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight resets. This ends loop C-0, T-0.

- - -

### C-0, T-1

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight goes ahead with her plan to lie to Celestia. She pretends to be deeply upset, insisting to Celestia that the loop counter is now at C-0, T-34 and that she can't carry on like this.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia believes Twilight's lie and apologises. She then immediately casts her Euthanatos spell, resetting to earlier that morning.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia makes a promise to herself that she will keep Twilight out of the loop and attempt to handle the invasion herself, and she will do this ten times for every loop that she and Twilight (supposedly) could not work together (ie. 340 loops).
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia spends 340 loops fighting the changeling invasion. In each of these loops, she goes to Twilight first thing in the morning, before she can cast the timeloop ritual, and sends her to study in the high-security arcane vault, keeping her safe from and unaware of the changeling invasion. Because Twilight never casts the timeloop ritual, her timelooped self does not manifest in any of these loops.

### C-340, T-1

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] After 340 loops of being repeatedly killed, and seeing her friends and family die, she cannot take any more. She resets and goes to Twilight's library, this time allowing her to cast the timeloop spell so that her timelooped self rejoins the loop again. This is loop C-340 T-34. (Technically, it's actually C-340, T-1, because Twilight lied about her 34 loops, but Celestia insists on using the numbers given to her by Twilight.)
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia breaks down and starts crying, recounting the 340 terrible loops she has just experienced. Twilight realises that her lie must have caused this, and is horrified at what she has put Celestia through. She eventually breaks down in tears and admits that she lied to Celestia.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight desperately tries to come up with a way to make it up to Celestia. She comes up with the following idea: Celestia should arrange an exercise, to teach her to work together with Celestia - the 'teachable moment'. To do so, Twilight suggests that Celestia leads Chrysalis to the library at the exact moment of Twilight's reset. Celestia would fight Chrysalis in the library, protecting Twilight from harm and proving that she cares enough about Twilight to risk injury and death for her. Twilight would use her timeloop to figure out how to drive Chrysalis off and save her teacher. Once she has succeeded, Celestia would explain that it was a lesson, then tell Twilight to reset and say a single word to her - 'Darjeeling'. That will be a signal to Celestia that the teachable moment has ended, and Twilight will retain her memories of fighting side by side with Celestia.
![Speculation alt text][pic_Speculation] If our inference is correct, that is actually a bad plan. It involves Celestia having to manipulate and lie to Twilight, then admit the lie afterward. Given that Twilight is already furious with Celestia because she believes she's being manipulated, it's difficult to see how this won't just make everything worse. Celestia says she thought it was a bad idea, but it's really difficult to see why she would go along with it. It's possible we have misunderstood what the teachable moment was.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia resets, and spends 36 loops figuring out how to lure Chrysalis to the library at the moment of Twilight's reset. Presumably Celestia dies several times during this - Chrysalis is a fearsome opponent in personal combat, and with her timelooping ability, can replay loops over and over again to improve her chances.

### C-376, T-1

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia resets, and makes another attempt to get Chrysalis to the library. Chrysalis attacks and blows a hole in the library just as Twilight's loop begins, seriously injuring Celestia. The result is that Twilight begins her loop to find the library in ruins, Celestia injured, and Chrysalis attacking.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Chrysalis battles Celestia as Twilight watches in horror.
![Speculation alt text][pic_Speculation] Presumably, Celestia has had this battle a few times already, but hasn't yet figured out how to do it without blowing up the library and getting herself injured. From the looks of the battle, both Celestia and Chrysalis are looping to figure out how to counter each other's attacks, as they make several improbable but effective moves. We know that Chrysalis spends about fifty loops attacking the library.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Chrysalis disables Celestia by shooting her in the neck.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Chrysalis prepares to kill Twilight. Twilight is prepared to die because she knows it will reset the loop and give her a chance to stop Chrysalis next time. Unfortunately, this suspicious acceptance of death causes Chrysalis to realise that Twilight is also a timelooper. Before Chrysalis can do anything, however, Twilight hits her with Home Run, knocking her unconscious.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight goes to help the injured Celestia, but Celestia catches her out with a question: "How many loops did that take you?" For Twilight, of course, the answer is one, and she says so.
![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia is utterly dismayed at this, because Twilight has managed to solve the teachable moment in a single loop, while it has taken Celestia 36 loops to set this up. She immediately believes Twilight is lying again, but it quickly becomes obvious that Twilight really did get lucky on her first try. This means the plan for the teachable moment will no longer work - Twilight won't remember anything about it if Celestia resets now, and Celestia is in so much pain from her injuries that she can't bear to spend any longer in this loop explaining the lesson. Nor does she want to keep trying to set up the teachable moment cleanly, it's too painful for her. She asks Twilight to reset and immediately say 'Darjeeling', to end the teachable moment. Twilight hesitates, wanting to know why, and Celestia admits that that this was a set up, intended to be the 'teachable moment', but because she hasn't had time to explain it, Twilight loses her temper. She's sick of being manipulated like this, and refuses to reset, until Celestia calms her down. After she's calmed down, Twilight casts Euthanatos and kills herself.

- - -

### C-376, T-2 - the Darjeeling loop

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight resets back to the moment of Chrysalis' attack on the library. She immediately says 'Darjeeling!'. It is technically C-376, T-2, but Celestia has counted it as C-376, T-35 because she is still using Twilight's numbers.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia resets her loop immediately, before Chrysalis can disable her.

### C-377, T-2

![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia returns to the beginning of the day. This time, she doesn't arrange an attack on the library, so Chrysalis doesn't appear in this loop. She goes to the library to meet Twilight at her reset point.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Twilight resets as Celestia explains to her that this is loop C-377, and that they've just had the Darjeeling loop. She finds that Twilight is still angry, and realises that the teachable moment didn't work. She is shocked to find that Twilight is on T-35, as it means she only spent one loop learning the teachable moment.
![Inferred alt text][pic_Inferred] Celestia tries to explain what happened to Twilight, but Twilight is still angry. Twilight gets a sudden stupid idea, and says 'Preengaged blackout deharmonizes antihunting dissertation' before Celestia can stop her. This activates Celestia's spell and paralyses Twilight, stopping their discussion. As before, Celestia hates seeing Twilight in pain like this, so she resets.

### C-378, T-2

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Celestia repeats the events of the last loop, this time informing Twilight that this is loop C-378. She suggests that they reset the counter to zero, to wipe the slate clean. This time, she knows that Twilight is going to try to say her phrase again, and stops her before she can. She eventually is able to calm Twilight down and explain everything to her. Twilight finally understands why it's so difficult to maintain trust in these conditions, and decides to try a little experiment of her own. She casts Euthanatos and resets herself.

- - -

### C-378, T-3

![Confirmed alt text][pic_Confirmed] Twilight resets as Celestia is explaining to her that this is loop C-378. Twilight wants to be absolutely sure that Celestia isn't manipulating her, so she pretends that this is the first time she has experienced this loop. Celestia behaves exactly as she did before, confirming to Twilight that Celestia hasn't done anything to manipulate her since she reset. Twilight finally trusts Celestia, and resets the loop.

- - -

### C-378, T-4

- Twilight resets, and immediately agrees to reset the loop counter to zero and start anew, now that they trust each other. She resets her loop.

- - -

### C-378, T-5

- Twilight resets, and tells Celestia that she's set her loop counter to zero, and that Celestia should now do the same and reset. Celestia does so.

### C-0, T-0

- The final loop count stands at C-379 for Celestia, T-5 for Twilight, but they have both agreed that from this point, the counter is at C-0, T-0, and they will be completely truthful about how many loops they have experienced.
