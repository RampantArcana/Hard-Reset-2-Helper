Chapter 3.0: The Teachable Moment Gone Wrong
--------------------------------------------

- A battered Celestia fights Chrysalis and is incapacitated  
- Chrysalis determines Twilight is looping as well
- Twilight finds Home Run sitting on the bookshelf.  Chrysalis is incapacitated (no death means no remembering Twilight is looping)
- Twilight starts apologizing and promises to help
- Celestia asks how many times it took - Not since the beginning, rather, how many it took to hit Chrysalis with Home Run
    - Celestia assumes Twilight died at least once
    - This would allow Celestia to reset and explain things in a peaceful environment
    - Instead since Twilight has gotten Chrysalis on the first try, Twilight must now reset
    - Celestia's frustration and pain gives away her ploy
    - Twilight gets _very_ angry
- Celestia reasons that if Twilight simply walks away, she will forget all her evidence against Celestia when Celestia resets
