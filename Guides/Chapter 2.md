Guide - Chapter 2
======================

This is a guide keeping track of loops external to Twilight for horizon's _Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder_ Chapter 2.

Chapter 2: Operation "Get Twilight to Help" Continued
---------

- Twilight is understandably confused as the last thing she remembers is Celestia killing her, and now she's actually **right there when Twilight's loop starts.**
- Celestia stops Twilight from saying the safeword and trigger - she has already heard this. (See Chapter 1.99 in Guide for Chapters 0 - 1)
- Twilight learns Celestia is now looping
- Twilight loses her temper because Celestia clearly could have stopped her from casting the loop spell but chose not to
    - Twilight interprets this as deliberately manipulating her into casting the spell
    - Celestia WAS standing right there waiting for the loop to take effect
- Celestia shows Twilight the Euthanatos spell and creates the death counter C0-T0
- Twilight resets
- A **LOT** happens for Celestia

Chapter 2.7: The Lie (C0-T1)
--------------------

- Twilight breaks down in front of Celestia, claiming the score is currently C0-T34.  She is lying to get out of the time loop
    - This _would_ mean despite their collaboration, Twilight is getting her flank handed to her
    - This _would_ mean that Celestia has forgotten Twilight dying 34 times including the first reset after the counter
    - Twilight claims everything breaks down into arguments that are tearing them apart
- Celestia agrees to reset and prevent Twilight from entering the time loop.  Celestia also vows to die at least 10 times as many deaths as Twilight "just has" before asking for her help again.

Chapter 2.8: Futility (C1 through C340-T1)
------------------------------------------

- Celestia and Chrysalis play cat and mouse again.  Chrysalis dies an unknown number of times.
- C340-T34 (really C340-T1) Celestia wearily lets Twilight enter the time loop again.  Desperate for real companionship, Celestia fails to allow Twilight to reset partway through the conversation to allow her to remember it.
- Twilight admits to the real count - C340-T1
- Twilight comes up with the idea of setting up a situation to demonstrate how dishonesty can be catastrophic in this situation
- Celestia attempts to set up the Teachable Moment and fails some more
- Chrysalis dies some more too (more than Celestia)

Chapter 2.9: Consequences (C376-T1)
-----------------------------------

- "C376, T34."  "You lied to me, Twilight."
