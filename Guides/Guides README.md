# Guides Readme

## About

The Guides presented in this section are in smaller bites.  The style is meant to be informal.  That way, a confused reader could look at only one or two small files around the chapter they read.  A full timeline will be added soon in the top level of the repository.

Horizon has described this as the Cliff Notes version of his/her story.

## Guide Notation

There's a few things to know when reading the Guides.  This also serves as style guidelines for writing/updating the Guides section.

### Chapter Notation

You will notice immediately that sections in the Guides are named as decimal versions of the chapter they walk through.  This is for a general reference of where in the Fic the events described take place.  

In general, if a section only has a quote, it means that it is directly referencing the Fic, not an implied event.  The Guides do not need to fully describe what is already written by Horizon.

Example: In the Chapter 0-1 Guide, The section title "Chapter 1.99" indicates the very end of the chapter.  Chapter 1.999 is a _quote_ of the end of the chapter, meaning the reader actually read that part and the Guide need not explain more.

### Referencing the Fic Directly

You must use quotation marks if you are literally copying text from the Fic.  All other text should be generic retelling using only enough description to orient the reader and get your point across.

If you want to reference a specific line from the story, use Calibre (an ebook reader).
- Download Calibre
- Install Calibre
- Download the Fic in epub format (right next to the story status and rating "Incomplete Teen" on the Fic's front page) - Note the date you downloaded it
- Add the epub Fic to Calibre's library
- Open the Fic
- Turn on Reference Mode (A tipping paint bucket with colorful circles around it)
- Mouse over the line you want to reference - You now have a Chapter/Paragraph provided to you
- Add your reference "Chapter/Paragraph - Date"  You **must** include the date you downloaded your epub version of the Fic.  If Horizon edits his/her Fic, we need to know we are using good quotes

### The Death Counter

Currently, Horizon has presented us with a death counter that tracks where Celestia and Twilight are relative to each other's knowledge.  This is also extremely useful for matching loops to sections in the Guides.  Currently used formats are
- C-###, T-###
    - This is the format Horizon uses within the Fic.  It takes up extra space but looks nicer overall.  Plus, the comma works nicely in dialogue, introducing a pause the reader _knows_ should be there.
- C###-T###
    - This is the format I (RampantArcana) started with.  It saves keystrokes and looks more like a scoreboard.

We may develop a method for tracking resets of the counter.  Possible notations include
- R#, C-###, T-###
- R#-C###-T###
