Twilight:
Princess? Do you want to kill some changelings?
Spill their ichor on the walls?
I ask because it's hard to say,
How many times today,
I've run down all these halls!
I've been looping for so long now,
And you were not,
I'm starting to lose my mind!
Do you want to kill some changelings?
Please you have to kill the changelings...
"I can't do this alone, Twilight."
Okay, I'll try...

"The train!  My friends..."

Celestia:
Do you want to see the world end?
You said it, we are very doomed.
See yourself that this is no eclipse,
It's my apocalypse,
Just step out of this small room!
Griffins, dragons, and changelings,
Ponies and zebras,
Joining forces but there's no time!
(Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock, BOOM!)

(Random back and forth during the interlude could change)
"You can count on me, Princess!"
"The first answer is yes, but you must never allow yourself to believe it."
"Princess, we've got a problem."
"You are not Twilight Sparkle!"
"Wait, this is a mistake!  Aaaah!"

Celestia:
Twilight, Please, I know you're in there.
I know I've been so very cruel.
It was wrong for me to have turned on you,
And now Luna too,
I played the fool!
I need to say I'm sorry!
I need you at my side,
I can't do this alone!
