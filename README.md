## Why am I here?

You're here because you like Eakin's _Hard Reset_ and horizon's _Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder_.  This repository is for the enthused and confused.  Use it as a reference guide!  Use it to debate theories!  Use it because you get to complain about/praise the the phrase "timey-wimey!"

## OK, Why is the Guide Here on GitHub?

Because versioning!  A crowdsourced guide for a story is going to change _**a lot**_ and we need to keep track of who contributed what.  This is especially important since horizon will not be taking direct action except to point out downright wrong stuff on the pages.

For those of you who don't know, Git is a versioning system that allows you to store the history of documents and code.  GitHub is a site that stores repositories using Git.  So basically I'm taking an advanced tool that is used in developing Linux and tracking a fan-run guide for a fanfiction story that is an alternate universe version of a fanfiction story for a TV show about ponies...

I feel a bit odd writing that last part.

## General Rules for this Repository:

1. ABSOLUTELY NO COPYING STORIES/CHAPTERS - You may quote small sections, preferably single lines.  Quotes should probably go in the issues/comments rather than actual guides.  I will work out a method for referencing sections in the story external to this repository.  If you start copying large sections of the story, your post will be deleted, removed from history, and you will be sternly warned.  These authors work hard.  Let's keep the traffic on _their_ stories.
2. Keep it clean - PG13 please?  Light language may be allowed, but keep away from F-bombs and racist speach.  Also, be kind when you are critically analyzing others' work.  Everyone's here to have fun and build our understanding of the story.  Theory crafting is meant to be fun, not combative.
