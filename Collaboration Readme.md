# Collaboration Readme

This Readme documents the methods and rules for collaborating on this project.

## Rules for Contributing:

1. Don't kill the repository - This is a given.  If you don't know what you're doing with Git or GitHub, read some tutorials or stick with the issue tracker/private messages/comments.  I will probably be keeping a local copy of the repo, but I don't want to have to reinitialize the project every week.
2. Don't kill the guide pages - Rewriting Git history makes me frown.  I'm somewhat new to Git.  Don't make me spend time looking at guides to run my guides.

## Ways to Contribute

### Comment on Horizon's Story!

This should be your go-to anyways.  Horizon is just like any other author who likes people commenting on what they do and don't like and the theories they have.  As a matter of fact, comment first, then duplicate anything you have to say about this repo using one of the methods below.  This repository isn't meant to detract from horizon's traffic, merely clean up the mess in the Comments section.  Mention my Fimfiction username in your comment if you want me to check it out.  I might create an issue for investigation on this repo from it.

### FimFiction PM

PM me on Fimfiction - Short and simple.

### GITHUB USERS: Create an issue on GitHub

Anyone who has a GitHub account can create issues directly on the repo.  An account is free and only requires an email address.
- Go to the little Issues tab on the right
- Select "New Issue" on the right side
- Give it a short, meaningful title and description of the problem or addition
- Mark the Milestone the issue applies to (Chapter 1, Rules and Players, All Chapters, Repo Maintenance etc.)
- Tag the issue with one or more of the appropriate tags, usually one for type and one for what folder it applies to (ADDITION, CORRECTION, SUGGESTION, GUIDES, THEORIES)
- Do NOT assign the issue.  If more users join to directly edit the repo, we will work out our own way of assigning work
- Click "Submit new issue"
Someone will assign the issue and start work on it eventually.  We will keep track of our progress in the comments section and may ask you for additional information about what you want added/fixed.

### GITHUB USERS WITH GIT EXPERIENCE: Collaborate Directly

If you have experience with GitHub, you can create a fork of the repository and pull request your changes.  I or another collaborator will merge your changes and ensure the Pre-Release branch gets updated as well.
- Create a fork of the repo
- Make sure an Issue is open for what you want to do (create one if there isn't!)
- Perform edits with appropriate comments on each commit
- Create a pull request and mention the open Issue (may include "fixes" tag to automatically close it)
- Someone will either merge it in or give you feedback

If you ask nicely, I'll add you as a collaborator.  Then you can work on the repo directly on the website! (Note to other closet bronies: GitHub does not like people trying to edit in Incognito mode)
- Message me to become a collaborator
- Only make changes that can be tracked by an EXISTING ISSUE.  If an issue does not exist, do not edit.  If you need to edit, first create an issue stating why.
- Work ONLY on the Pre-Release branch
- Submit changes for release by creating a Pull Request into master branch
- Failure to follow this simple workflow will result in ejection from collaborator status

## How NOT to Contribute:

1. Email - I (RampantArcana) am a closet brony so this is a throwaway name.  My email will probably go unchecked months at a time.

## Git Tools RampantArcana Uses

I'm on a Windows machine so I use the git backend with Sourcetree to manage repositories.  I hiss in the general direction of the command prompt (see "Windows user."  Synonyms include "blasphemer") so Sourcetree is nice for people who like clicking things.  Winmerge is nice for comparing versions of files and P4merge (just the merge client, _nothing else_) is nice if Git histories do not match for an auto-merge.
